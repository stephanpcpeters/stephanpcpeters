## Hi! I'm Stephan

I'm a teacher and researcher working at Windesheim University of Applied Science. My current focus is mostly on data science, machine learning and AI.

I hold a PhD in Astronomy and have published a few papers in that field. Check out my papers here: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IODuYZYAAAAJ
